## Rodrigo Straccioni â€“ Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

This site was created to present my professional background, core skills, certifications, and the projects I have worked on. It also reflects my personality and design preferences. Every part of it was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any frameworks.

The purpose of this project is not only to showcase my experience as a Technical Consultant but also to demonstrate my ability to structure and develop a clean, responsive, and interactive website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (responsive layout, animations, custom design)  
- JavaScript (navigation behavior, smooth scrolling, ScrollReveal)  
- Boxicons  
- Google Fonts  
- ScrollReveal.js  
- Deployment: Vercel
